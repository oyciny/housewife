# House Wife
House Wife is the do all javascript package. She can do all your chores for you while you focus on what matters.
[![NPM VERSION][npm image]][npm url]

## Installation
To get a house wife of your own simply run:
```console
npm i housewife
``` 
in your terminal and import the package into your project.

## Features
### Clean
Make your housewife clean any array you hand her. She will gladly take any array of data and clean it based on how you tell her how. And she WON'T throw a bitch fit!

## Future Plans
Right now housewife is a basic bitch. She can't do much but she is very good at what she can do. In the future we plan on teaching her how to handle even more tasks. Here are a few tasks we have planned for her to learn:
* Shop - Traverse the web and deliver anything you could ever want
* Organize - Pass her data and she will organize it into whatever format you like
* Count - Give her anything countable and she will count it
* Complain - Every house wife has a knack for compaining. That's why our house wife will to! She will complain about every thing you do wrong!
* And Much more!

## Notice
This house wife is not very good at the moment but we plan to whip her into shape over time. Stay with us to see the progress we make on her over time.
